- 👋 Hi, I’m @singye. I build bridges between intuitive web interfaces and intelligent algorithms.

- 👀 I’m interested in:
    - **Web:** Full-stack development (React & Python/Node.js), performant APIs (GraphQL/REST), modern frontend tooling, and building scalable web applications.
    - **AI/ML:** Deep Learning architectures (especially Transformers!), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs - prompting, fine-tuning, RAG, Agents), Computer Vision (object detection, segmentation), and the underlying math that makes it all work.
    - **Intersection:** Creating interactive AI-powered web apps, MLOps (deploying models effectively), and visualizing complex data/model outputs on the web.

- 🌱 I’m currently:
    - Diving deeper into efficient LLM fine-tuning techniques (like LoRA/QLoRA).
    - Experimenting with multimodal models (text <-> image).
    - Exploring real-time Computer Vision deployment strategies for web applications.
    - Getting hands-on with vector databases for semantic search and RAG pipelines.
    - Trying to master asynchronous tasks on both the backend and frontend without losing my sanity.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
    - Open-source projects that integrate LLMs or CV models into practical web tools.
    - Building interactive demos for novel research papers in ML/DL.
    - Projects exploring generative AI for creative web applications.

- 📫 How to reach me:
    - Best way is via Email: `[singyedorji0221@gmail.com]` (especially for project ideas!).
    - Connect professionally on [www.linkedin.com/in/singye-dorji-bb528a233].

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (or `model.predict(context)`)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I spend roughly equal amounts of time debugging JavaScript nuances and tuning neural network hyperparameters. Sometimes I think my GPU needs its own cooling system separate from my CPU... and my coffee. I also believe "It works on my machine" is simultaneously the best and worst phrase in tech.
